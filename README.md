Train Detection Automated Gate System

The Train Detection Automated Gate system is designed to enhance railway crossing safety by automatically controlling gate operations using sensor-based train detection. The system employs an Arduino or ESP32 microcontroller paired with ultrasonic sensors to detect the presence of a train. When a train approaches, the sensor identifies it, and a servo motor is triggered to close the gate. Once the train has passed, the gate reopens.

Key Components:

Arduino UNO or ESP32

Ultrasonic sensors

Servo motor

Resistors, breadboard, jumper wires

Power supply

Working Procedure:

The microcontroller interfaces with ultrasonic sensors placed along the railway track.

The sensor continuously measures distance to detect train presence.

If the measured distance falls below a threshold (indicating a train is near), the gate closes via a servo motor.

Once the train moves away, the gate reopens.

This system offers an automated, cost-effective solution for enhancing safety at railway crossings, minimizing human error, and ensuring timely gate operations.
